Problem2:   Greatest Common Divisor of Strings
-----------------------------------------------
For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).
Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.
 

Example 1:

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"

Example 3:

Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""

Constraints:

    1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
    str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution Explained:
--------------------
1. If there is a string "x" that divides both str1 and str2, it means if we keep multiplying "x" with itself then at one point we will
    get str1 and str2.
    e.g. if str1 = hihihi and x = hi, then we get str1 after multiplying x 3 times.

2. if 2 string share a common "x" divider then str1 + str2 must be equal to str2 + str1.

3. the Solution class has a gcdOfStrings(self, str1, str2)  method, it takes str1 and str2 as argument.

4.  we check if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:
            return "" #return and empty string if they are not equal.

5. we find the common length string that repeats within both string using the common_length = gcd(len(str1), len(str2)) function.

6. the def gcd(a,b)  method takes length of str1 and str2 as a and b respectively, and finds the gcd of a ,b i.e. the length of the 
    common string, using euclidean theorem.

    def gcd(a, b):
            while b:                    # while b value is not equal to 0
                a, b = b, a % b         # set a value equal to b, and b value equal to the reminder of a%b.     
            return a                    # when a%b becomes 0, the value of a is the gcd of a and b.


7. return str1[:common_length] returns the common string 


8. # Example usage:
solution = Solution()       # create an instance of Solution class
str1 = "ABCABC"             # value of str1 is set to ABCABC
str2 = "ABC"                # value of str2 is set to ABC
result = solution.gcdOfStrings(str1, str2)  #calling the gcdOfStrings function in Solution class
print(result)                # print the result.
